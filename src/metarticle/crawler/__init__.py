    Today my startup failed

No soft landing, no happy ending—we simply failed.

It’s been a long four year journey, full of highs and lows. I am simultaneously incredibly proud, and incredibly disappointed.

I’m incredibly proud of an amazing team and all that they have accomplished. Our most recent product, DrawQuest, is by all accounts a success. In the past year it’s been downloaded more than 1.4 million times, and is currently used by about 25,000 people a day, and 400,000 last month alone. Retention and engagement are great. And yet we still failed.

It may seem surprising that a seemingly successful product could fail, but it happens all the time. Although we arguably found product/market fit, we couldn’t quite crack the business side of things.

Building any business is hard, but building a business with a single app offering and half of your runway is especially hard (we created DrawQuest after the failure of our first product, Canvas). I’ve come away with new found respect for those companies who excel at monetizing mobile applications. As we approached the end of our runway, it became clear to us that DrawQuest didn’t represent a venture-backed opportunity, and even with more time that was unlikely to change.

I’m terribly saddened that this may spell the end for our wonderful community, but it’s my goal to use what little money we’ll have left after the wind-down to keep the service alive for another few months. However as of today the team has gone their separate ways, and our doors are effectively closed.

I’m disappointed that I couldn’t produce a better outcome for those who supported me the most—my investors and employees. Few in business will know the pain of what it means to fail as a venture-backed CEO. Not only do you fail your employees, your customers, and yourself, but you also fail your investors—partners who helped you bring your idea to life.

In my case, I am extremely lucky and grateful to be partners with people who are simply the best. What separates the best investors is not how they help you when you’re a rocketship, but when your ship is on fire and you’re venting atmosphere. In this case, our investors have demonstrated what sets them apart from the rest—they’ve supported me throughout the ups and downs, and especially the downs.

With that said, life goes on, and the best path forward is not a wounded one, but a more learned and motivated one. I’m definitely not itching to start another company any time soon—it will take time to decompress and reflect on the events of the past four years—but I hope that if I do some day decide to pursue a new dream, I’ll be in a much better position to. After all, I did just receive a highly selective, four-year education for a mere $3.6 million dollars! (I find humor helps as well.)

As for what’s next for me, I honestly have no idea. This is the first time in four years I’ve been at a crossroads like this.

One thing I’ll be doing more of is writing about my experience. Partially because it’s therapeutic, but also because if there’s a silver lining in all of this (and there is), it’s that I can help educate others about a path fraught with hardship, but rewarding nonetheless.

I’m also particularly inspired by what Everpix has done by making so much of their story public, and hope many others will follow in their footsteps of radical transparency. I don’t wish to glorify my failure, but it’s certainly something I’d rather embrace than hide behind for the next five years.

On that note, if there are any specific topics you’d like me to write about, feel free to submit them via my Ask page. Or if you’d like to say hi in general, please don’t hesitate to e-mail me at moot@4chan.org. Believe me—I’ll have a lot of free time on my hands these next few weeks.

Last but not least, to my team—Dave, Eunsan, Alex, Nick, Shaun, and Jim—I am eternally grateful. To my investors—Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Lerer Ventures, SV Angel, Founder Collective, Chris Dixon, and Joshua Schachter—I could not have done this without you.

And to everyone who has supported us over the past few years, from the bottom of my heart: thank you.

    Blurtt, which launched in its current form back in 2012, was a mobile app that allowed you to create their own digital expressions by allowing you to choose an image, add text and share either anonymously or to your network. Now in 2014, my beloved startup Blurtt is dead and all the assets are for sale.

As one of the cofounders of the company, I thought it would be helpful to walk you through the many incarnations of Blurtt and the challenges we had along the way in hope that other startups can avoid our mistakes.

Death By Too Many Business Models

Ideas are a dime a dozen; the difference is in the execution. Below is a list of business models Blurtt considered, built and attempted to raise money on:

Idea No. 1 in 2009

Web and mobile platform that curates photography and art from individuals and you can create and send your own postcard from your phone for $1.99.

Executed: Functional web platform that was live and running.

Problem: We saw a new opportunity (idea No. 2) and changed the business model but needed funding to iterate and scale.

Funding: Bootstrapped with investor interest but no commitments.

Assessment: While many postcard app startups have received funding, this is a lifestyle business. If you want to turn it into a fundable business, you need multiple revenue channels and products. The exits, if there are any, will be small.

Idea No. 2 in 2010

Web and mobile platform that allows you to send free postcards in the mail with an advertisement on the back.

Executed: Along with our web-based Blurtt-creation tool, we created a functional self-service advertisement portal similar to Facebook Ads that allowed you to choose your target demographics, location and gender. In order to send blurtts, we required Facebook Connect, which allowed us to get your data and match you with the advertiser.

Problem: At this point we turned off monetization for Blurtt and they could be sent for free. However, we had no ad partners, as advertisers wanted to see high volume, and our fixed costs (printing, mailing, hosting) started to add up without any funding or revenue. I had to shut down Blurtt.

Funding: Bootstrapped. Tried to raise money but feedback we received was that no one wanted to send printed postcards, and the name “Blurtt” was not good for snail mail as “blurt” implied impulsivity. The impulsivity of expression would be lost in the mail.

Assessment: A startup recently launched in this space, and I think they will run into the same problems. The idea is good but you are adding an impersonal advertisement to a postcard that is supposed to convey emotion. While advertisers are trying to learn how to read and convey emotion through advertisements, it will take a considerable amount of funding and users to make this business model work.

Idea No. 3 in 2011

Mobile platform of micro-gifting and greeting cards.

Executed: Spent most of the year raising money on this idea. We received an acceleration agreement from Archimedes Labs in Silicon Valley.

Problem:  The money we’d need to raise to make this happen would need to be considerable. We decided to build an MVP instead which at least addressed one of the two ideas.

Funding: Raised our first $25K, which made it easier to raise more money.

Assessment: The MVP ended up being Idea No. 4.

Idea No. 4 in 2011-2012

Mobile platform that allows you to choose an image from the web (or your camera roll) and add text over the image and share digitally. The blurtts could be shared anonymously or via your user name. The idea here was to give people a platform to use images to better convey how they truly felt. (An image is worth a thousand words.)

Executed: Mobile app launched in 2012. We were featured in TechCrunch and Mashable’s Top 6 Apps to Download for the Week alongside Angry Birds.

Problem: It is hard to force a Blurtt. When we were working through the MVP it felt like “blurtting” was something one just had to get good at. Blurtt became a content-creation tool of which only 0.02475 percent of the people were actually both funny or clever extroverts who wanted to share their blurtts with the universe.

Funding: We came close to closing a $1 million dollar seed round. When the investment discussion turned to who was going to run Blurtt and what team was going to build it, I had a falling out with the lead investor. I raised a $120K friends and family round and built and launched an MVP using those funds.

Assessment: For the niche who is original, witty and creative, Blurtt was the tool for them.  Some of the content people started creating and sharing was vile and not at all the vision I had for Blurtt. We could not find product/market fit but had several ideas of where Blurtt could go. I did not have enough funding to iterate real-time. Blurtt started to fizzle away but I was going to give it one last shot.

Saving Blurtt…Again

I have a Joan of Arc complex so the only time I will give up is when they burn me at the stake.

We launched Blurtt (idea No. 4) in March 2012, and by September 2012 it was obvious that we were not getting the traction we needed to raise money. I convinced one of my business classmates to let me live with her in New York City as I tried to find a technical co-founder (i.e. free developer) who could help me with Blurtt.

At this point, I had my bags packed and I went to say goodbye to the team I had hired to help me build my MVP, a product development company in Dallas called Dialexa. Co-founders Mark Haidar and Scott Harper said, “You can’t just leave Dallas. You are way too smart and too talented to be sleeping on floors and couches and begging people to help you. We will take over Blurtt and you become the product manager and you can work for us.”

After making zero salary for two years, managing $120,000 to build a product that might have taken any other person 2-4x that amount to build, I accepted Dialexa’s offer.

The Personal Side No One Likes To Talk About

I joined Dialexa and we were all happy that Blurtt was getting another chance. But I started to feel burned out. I was Blurtt’s fearless leader, but the problem with burnout is that you become hopeless and you lose every aspect of your creativity. I would stay awake at night thinking about Blurtt (what to do with it, punishing myself for my mistakes, thinking about the people who hurt me along the way and said I did not meet the “pattern of recognition for success” in the Valley). I’d go to work feeling tired and exhausted. I was burning the candle at both ends.

If I had not had two to three years of battle wounds to recover from maybe I could have bounced back quicker, but I was spent: emotionally, physically, financially and mentally. I asked my investors (who were thankfully my friends and family and understood) to give me a year to see if I could find it within me to save the company.

After reviewing more business opportunities within Blurtt I realized it was time to let it go. In the end, time is actually your most valuable resource.

Some Other Takeaways

Taking venture money is not the end all, be all. I remember getting asked questions like “Is this a lifestyle business?” like it was a bad thing. The reality is VCs look for big exits so they don’t want to invest in your multi-million-dollar venture even if you’re making millions. I kept on changing the vision to appeal to investors so I could chase the bigger dollars so I could build the startup I really hoped to build. In the end, the passion and magic was lost.

Do not launch a startup if you do not have enough funding for multiple iterations. The chances of getting it right the first time are about the equivalent of winning the lotto.

Remember why you started this in the first place and never lose sight of it, because once it becomes something you are not happy doing — you shouldn’t be doing it. I wanted to change the world by giving people a way to express their true emotions.

I want to take this time to thank Blurtt’s cofounders Laura Jensen Gurasich, Kuba Tymula, and Nikhil Sethi who never gave up on me. My team at Dialexa who stepped up to the plate when things got especially tough and helped me get an MVP out that dazzled the world, even if just for a short while. And to my investors and my family, thank you for believing in me. When you invested in Blurtt, you invested in me. This won’t be my last rodeo.

Account management startup Manilla says that it will be shutting down on July 1.

We received several tips about the shutdown today, then when I visited the site and tried to sign up, I was directed to this announcement, which says that the service will continue to operate as normal until June 30. After that, users will no longer be able to upload new documents, and it will not retrieve any new data, though documents will still be stored on and downloadable from Manillauntil September 30.

“This was a hard decision given that, over the past three years, Manilla has won many awards and has been well supported by its valued user base but was unable to achieve the scale necessary to make the economics of the business viable,” the company wrote.

Incubated and backed by publishing company Hearst, Manilla launched at the DEMO conference in February 2011 with the promise of giving users a single website where they can pay their bills and manage their accounts (and access them on mobile apps as well). The service opened to the public a few months later.

Manilla also partnered with AOL, which owns TechCrunch, to create an AOL Bill Manager last year.

The company said that all the account credentials that users had entered into Manilla (so that it could connect to other services) will be deleted on July 1, as will all other data aside from un-downloaded documents.

When facing the reality of a failed product and 3 months runway left of investors money, sometimes the best solution is to go to Thailand.

In early 2012 Thomas and I envisioned a future where recreational football players would use an app to share their matches with friends and family. All their history of achievements would be recorded that would become their online football identity.

Using mockup design we tested the idea at KB (football club in Copenhagen) with players and coaches. The response was very positive. So we gave ourselves three months to build the first version of the app and test with a group of teams.

At the time I could work full time as I just sold my previous startup. Thomas on the other hand was contracted at Scandinavia’s biggest deal site to upgrade their whole backend. A tall order for any hacker. So building this app on the side would not going to be easy.

As I started working in the morning, Thomas would join me after his work and code till late after midnight. Those three months I think he slept 4-5 hours each night.



Clear vision and validation ironed out

Pumodo was launched in App Store in mid April with 5 test teams. The feedback was promising and the data showed that each user would in average add 6.4 players to his team. A very good growth indicator.

Interviews showed that spectators really loved the idea to get live score notification from the matches they were unable to attend. The math was that each player had in average 3 fans so a team had 45 in total. Often only 5 people attended a match so there would be 40 friends and family at home wanting to be updated on that match. The key would be getting players to track their matches.

 image

A Skype meeting with senior level guys at Adidas confirmed that we were on right track in regards to our monetization model. They were committed to launch a campaign in our app once we reached a specific amount of users.

Thomas and I had the proof we needed. He just finished the contracting assignment so it was perfect timed as he could go full time on the project.

We also decided to work on the app the next three months in Silicon Valley. We’d had never been there before and it sounded like fun.

There we also could test the US market that was among the top 3 in size in regards to active recreational football players.



Do or do not. There is no try

In August we left for Palo Alto where we were invited to stay for two weeks for free in a cabin build in a backyard. The host was an awesome guy we met a year before in Copenhagen and one of the most esteemed growth hackers in The Valley.

image

From the comfort of the backyard cabin we moved to big city San Francisco and faced the totally hopeless situation of finding a place to live. We survived the first two weeks by renting office space at Tradeshift and sleeping on their couches at night. Not sure if they ever found that out.

Finally we managed to get a 9 m2/97 sqft room through our Y-Combinator network. Rent $1,250. Dang! But since we had free office space from our friends at OneLogin, our burnrate wasn’t yet gone through the roof. But close..

We did the show and tell dance at Techcrunch Disrupt and DEMO. Networked at GigaOm RoadMap Con and  YC Startup School. Got tons of advice. Met people with amazing experience. We felt we were in the nexus of entrepreneurship and innovation. And we probably were. But we also got tangled in the hype machine. Our business plan was changing every week. We went from focusing only on football to becoming app for all sports. Think BIGGER was the mantra.

It was like our feet never touched the ground.



image



Our market research showed USA would not become our main market. Too fragmented and unfavorable league structures. Europe would be our target.

So in November we headed back to Copenhagen just in time for the Danish App Awards where we were nominated for Best Sports App and Best Functionality. With our feet on solid ground yet again we won as Best Sports App. Sweet!

And since we had been contacted by Danish business angels interested in investing, we felt everything was going as planned.

Winter is coming

One of the biggest disadvantages with recreational football in Europe was the long winter breaks. In Denmark it was 5 months. I felt like Ned Stark facing many years of winter. It rendered our app lifeless and desolate. No live user data to use to improve the app as majority of our users were based in the cold north of Europe.

Trying to remain positive we saw it as an opportunity to submerge into our hack cave to build the next big feature.

We wanted to solve the lack of ability to compare players across different positions.  Current comparable metrics were goals and assist. It was not possible for a defender and forward to compare fairly.

The solution was an universal score based on players abilities to compare and compete against anybody regardless of age, level or position in lineup. Kinda like Klout score just for football players. The bigger impact you have in a matches, the higher is your score.

Concept explained here:





Clubs were offered a widget that showed Team of the Week based on the players’ score and a leaderboard among the clubs players. We wanted the clubs to celebrate individual players weekly achievements with place on the clubs Team of the Week

The hypothesis was that if we can get a club to place it on their club page and promote it, the players would want to be on the weekly Team Of Week so they download the app and start tracking their matches.

This was our growth hack.
